this hurt my brain

#TIL

Arrays with ES6 and writing in short hand.

This is the first day I was overwhelmed and felt a little defeated.  Wes B did say at the end of the video that it was a tough one and to review it until your comfortable.  so I may go back over this 2-3 more times when I've finished hte 30 days.
There's nothing really to see here except in the console.

It was hard, it was so freaking hard.
